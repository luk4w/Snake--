## Description
Snake++ is a classic snake game implemented in C++. It utilizes the GLFW library for window management, Glad for OpenGL loading, and GLM for mathematics.

## Features
- **Boundary and Self-Collision Detection:** The snake interacts with both the game boundaries and its own body, preventing it from going off-screen or consuming itself.
- **Random Food Generation:** Food items appear randomly, ensuring they never overlap with the snake's position.

## Dependencies
- GLFW
- Glad
- GLM

## Installation
- Clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/luk4w/Snake--.git```
- Open the project folder with Visual Studio Code.
- Configure and build the project with CMake.
